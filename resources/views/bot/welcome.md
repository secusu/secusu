*What can this bot do?*

[@the_secu_bot](@the_secu_bot) is the official bot of [SËCU](https://secu.su). Use it to create encrypted data containers that will be destroyed upon receipt.

You should add a password prefixed with `/p` to encrypt your message:

```
/p PASSWORD your message
```
or

```
/p PASSWORD
your message
```
Using this bot means that your data can be encrypted only after being sent to our servers as plain text. To ensure encryption happens before, please use the original web application.
